# Blog2 Big Data - Austin Xiong and Julius Tyson

This project uses data from the Amherst College Emergency Medical Service (ACEMS) to explore trends in campus medical emergencies. In the blog post we address three central questions. First, where and when do campus emergencies typically occur? To answer, we summarize ACEMS responses, tracking the locations and types of calls which are most prevalent. Second, how can we use ACEMS data to measure COVID policy? We explore how effective restrictions were on minimizing social interaction --- using the frequency of alcohol and narcotics calls as a proxy for campus socialization. Third, what is the purview of ACEMS? When should a responder expect to escalate a call to the Amherst Fire Department (AFD)? We analyze which types of calls are typically escalated.
